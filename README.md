# CS211 - Computer Architechture
Programming assignments for Computer Architechture course at Rutgers

This is a basic overview of the assignments, further details can be found in the PDFs located within each folder.

pa1 - "The first assignment is intended to familiarize you with the Unix environment and with C programming. You will write six simple C programs"
Programs:
*roman: Decoding Roman numerals
*palindrome: String operations I
*rle: String operations II
*list: Linked lists
*mexp: Matrix manipulation
*bst: Binary search trees

pa2 - "This assignment will give you more experience with C programming, dynamic allocation, and file I/O.
You will implement a simple machine-learning algorithm which will estimate house prices using data points given in several input files.
The attached PDF file describes the algorithm, including the matrix inversion procedure your program will use."

pa3 - "For this assignment, you will need to download a "binary bomb" from the web site given in the instructions. 
You will execute this program on an iLab machine, and attempt to determine the inputs which will defuse the bomb."

pa4 - "For this assignment, you will develop a C program that produces truth tables for circuits that are described in a circuit description language."

pa5 - This assignment will provide some experience with the ideas behind caching. You will implement a cache simulator in C, which will be given
(a) the configuration of a particular cache to simulate, and (b) a trace file describing the memory reads and writes of a program.
Your simulator will calculate the number of cache hits and misses, along with the number of reads and writes to memory,
that would occur if this program were run on a system using the specified cache."
